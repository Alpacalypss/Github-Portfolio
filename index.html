				<h3>A Brief History And Hopes Moving Forward</h3>
					<p>I spent the first 12 years of my adult life as a kitchen manager, and cook. My previous career path as a long term chef, created a void in my life of something I crave. <strong>Challenge</strong>. 
						There were a lot of great times had, many useful and translateable skills, and I met some <em>indescribably amazing people</em> along the way.
						despite all of the positives, I found myself bored with the monotouny of solving the same problem, day in and day out.
						I needed to find something new to challenge me and allow me to use my problem solving skills, and stubborn resolve, a more creative way.
						This led me down a rabbit hole of potential new careers.</p>
					<p>During my transitional outreach, I kept seeing bootcamps, and schooling opportunities coming across my desk for coding. I decided to spend a few weeks diving in and 
						seeing if it was something that interested me. I immediately fell in love. I always enjoyed learning, but this went beyond that. I thoroughly enjoy solving problems,
						working with other people, and I find I am able to put my best work out under pressure (whether that be time, or personal). I decided at the end of August 2023, 
						that needed to be the last summer I put myself through the grueling 100+ degree kitchen environment, and get to doing something I could be proud of, and enjoy
						as much as I did cooking, if not more. I did some research and found <strong>Thinkful</strong>. I chose it, because I am adept at self learning, pacing, and motivation. They 
						gave me that opportunity, while providing me a structured enviornment, and practice, to hone all these new skills.</p>
					<p>I'm always looking to improve in every aspect of things I can do. When I trained new people in the kitchen, I always told them "the day you come to work
						thinking you already know everything, is the day you fail. There's always something you can do better than yesterday." It feels a little cheesy, but I
						do firmly believe that, and that mindset pushed me further every day.</p> 
					<p>I have quite a few hobbies outside of work life:</p>
						<ul class="list-inside">
							<li>Landscaping</li>
							<li>Furniture Building</li>
							<li>Skateboarding</li>
							<li>Juggling</li>
							<li>Fire Spinning</li> 
							<li>Gymnastics</li>
							<li>Coffee</li>
							<li>Cooking</li>
							<li>And A Love of Games(board, video, puzzles, etc.)</li>
						</ul>

					<p>My ecclectic array of interests has always been a great motivator for me. The more things I try, the more passion I find. One of my favorite things to do is find
						someone who is great at something, and learn everything I can from them. Likewise, when I have a skill that someone else wants to learn, I always enjoy
						getting to teach them what I know! Sparking joy, and passion in others is in a lot of ways, even more rewarding than doing it yourself.</p>
